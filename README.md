# Cryptex Terminal – A Real-Time Encryption Interface

Cryptex Terminal is a full-stack cryptography web app that lets users encrypt and decrypt text messages in real-time using Python’s Fernet symmetric encryption.
Built with React on the frontend and Flask on the backend, this project provides a seamless and hacker-styled interface for experimenting with secure message encoding.

Whether you're a curious beginner learning about encryption or a developer looking to integrate lightweight cryptography into your workflow — Cryptex Terminal offers a clean, interactive sandbox.
